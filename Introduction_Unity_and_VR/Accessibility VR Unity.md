# Accessible VR Design
Be creative and think outside of conventions. Designing for accesibility can be fun!

## Diverse Input Methods
- Offer various interaction methods (e.g., traditional controllers, hand tracking, gaze-based inputs).
- Enable users to remap controls or adjust sensitivity settings.
- In you VR experience, check whether you can e.g.
    - enable one-handed interaction
    - add haptic feedback during user-input
    - implement voice-control

## Multimodal Output
### Clear and Intuitive Interfaces
- **Readable UI Elements:** Use legible fonts, adequate text sizes, and high-contrast color schemes to ensure text and menus are easy to read.
- **Spatial Clarity:** Organize 3D interfaces and menus so that they are easy to locate and interact with in the virtual space.

### Audio-visual Feedback
- **Audio Cues:** Utilize spatial audio to reinforce game events and guide players, providing an extra layer of feedback.
- **Visual Indicators:** Support audio feedback with visual cues (e.g., highlights, animations) to help all players understand interactions and environmental cues.

## Comfort and Minimize Motion Sickness
When it comes to accessibility, keep in mind that for many users VR might still be a novel medium. If you want to design also for unexperienced users try to keep movements simple:
- **Movement Alternatives:** Implement comfort options such as teleportation, snap turning, or adjustable locomotion to reduce the risk of motion sickness.
- **Accommodate Different Play Styles:** Offer both seated and room-scale gameplay options to support players with varied mobility levels.
